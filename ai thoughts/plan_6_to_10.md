# Baahouse Additional Action Plans

## Plan 6: Tile Pattern Optimization
**Priority: Medium**

**Objective:** Optimize tile definitions to reduce mathematical complexity while maintaining visual diversity.

**Actions:**
- Analyze mathematical complexity of current tile functions
- Identify opportunities to simplify complex expressions
- Ensure all inverse pairs have complementary but non-trivial patterns
- Optimize rendering performance for complex tiles

**Benefits:**
- Improved rendering performance
- More maintainable tile definitions
- Better balance between simplicity and functionality

## Plan 7: Advanced Rendering Options
**Priority: Medium**

**Objective:** Enhance rendering capabilities beyond basic black/white output.

**Actions:**
- Add support for grayscale output (multiple color values)
- Implement color mapping options for visual enhancement
- Create anti-aliasing support for smoother edges
- Add multi-resolution rendering support

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced visual output quality
- Greater creative flexibility
- Better visualization of complex tile patterns

## Plan 8: Tile Library Categorization
**Priority: Low**

**Objective:** Organize tile patterns into logical categories for better navigation.

**Actions:**
- Group tiles by function (geometric, organic, textural)
- Create tag system for tile properties (symmetrical, complex, simple)
- Develop tile similarity clustering
- Build tile recommendation system

**Benefits:**
- Easier tile selection for specific purposes
- Better understanding of tile set coverage
- Improved user experience for tile discovery

## Plan 9: Format Extension Support
**Priority: Low-Medium**

**Objective:** Extend baahouse format to support additional features and encoding schemes.

**Actions:**
- Implement the 'c' compression scheme as mentioned in SPEC.md
- Add support for palette-based color encoding ('256' option in SPEC.md)
- Create 't' text overlay extension support
- Develop backward compatibility for new format versions

**Benefits:**
- Reduced file sizes with compression
- Enhanced color capabilities
- Richer image format features

## Plan 10: Performance Analysis and Optimization
**Priority: Medium**

**Objective:** Conduct comprehensive performance analysis of all tools and optimize for large-scale usage.

**Actions:**
- Profile rendering performance across all tile functions
- Optimize memory usage for large image generation
- Implement parallel processing for multi-tile operations
- Create performance benchmarks and regression tracking

**Benefits:**
- Faster rendering for large images
- Better memory efficiency
- Scalable processing capabilities
