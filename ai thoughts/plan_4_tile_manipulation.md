# Baahouse Tile Manipulation and Composition Tools Plan - DISCONTINUED

## Status: DISCONTINUED

## Reason for Discontinuation
Based on project direction review, the development of tile manipulation and composition tools is not currently aligned with core project goals. The focus remains on:

- Core tile definition and validation
- Proper metaprogramming patterns and automated dispatch
- Robust testing and validation infrastructure
- Efficient rendering and file format support

## Original Objective (Archived)
Develop tools for combining, transforming, and manipulating individual tiles.

## Original Priority: High (now reduced)

## Alternative Focus Areas
- Enhance existing rendering tools based on metaprogramming patterns
- Improve validation and testing coverage
- Expand file format compatibility and robustness
- Optimize performance of core operations

## Archive Note
Original plan preserved for reference but not actively pursued at this time. Revisit may be considered in future project phases when core objectives are fully realized.
