# Baahouse New Action Plans

## Plan 11: Bauhaus-inspired Tile Design
**Priority: High**

**Objective:** Create additional tiles inspired by Bauhaus design principles that emphasize simplicity, functionality, and geometric forms.

**Actions:**
- Research authentic Bauhaus design elements and patterns
- Create minimalistic geometric patterns with clear composition
- Implement bold, clean lines and forms
- Focus on balance and proportion following Bauhaus principles
- Document design inspiration for each new tile

**Benefits:**
- Expands artistic style range of tile library
- Adds curated design aesthetic to the collection
- Maintains focus on functional geometric patterns

## Plan 12: Pattern Analysis Tool (Tile Consideration Tool)
**Priority: High**

**Objective:** Develop tooling to analyze visual characteristics of tile patterns statistically.

**Actions:**
- Implement statistical analysis of white/black pixel ratios
- Create symmetry detection algorithms
- Add pattern complexity scoring
- Implement visual similarity clustering tools
- Build pattern categorization systems
- Create visualization tools for tile properties

**Benefits:**
- Better understanding of tile set diversity
- Automated identification of similar patterns
- Enhanced organization and categorization
- Statistical insights into pattern distribution

## Plan 13: Tile Refinement and Elimination
**Priority: High**

**Objective:** Systematically eliminate redundant tiles and refine existing patterns based on statistical analysis.

**Actions:**
- Run comprehensive redundancy analysis across all 100 tiles
- Use tile consideration tool to identify problematic patterns
- Remove tiles with inverse relationships where appropriate
- Refine tile patterns to ensure good white/black balance
- Verify all patterns contribute meaningful visual diversity
- Create validation tools for ongoing quality control

**Benefits:**
- Eliminate duplicate/inverse patterns
- Maintain high-quality diverse tile set
- Ensure each tile provides unique value
- Balanced distribution of patterns

## Plan 14: Development Process Improvement
**Priority: Medium**

**Objective:** Improve development workflow and validation processes for tile creation.

**Actions:**
- Establish systematic testing for all new tiles
- Create validation pipeline for new tile submissions
- Implement automated checks for tile properties
- Document best practices for tile design
- Create standards for tile complexity and balance
- Build tools for previewing and analyzing new tiles

**Benefits:**
- Higher quality tile development
- Consistent tile characteristics
- Reduced need for post-creation fixes
- Streamlined development process

## Plan 15: Bauhaus Documentation and Style Guide
**Priority: Medium**

**Objective:** Create comprehensive documentation for Bauhaus-inspired patterns.

**Actions:**
- Document design principles behind each tile
- Create visual references to famous Bauhaus works
- Establish style guidelines for future tile creation
- Build educational resources for users
- Curate tile collections by style themes

**Benefits:**
- Educational value for users
- Consistent design approach
- Historical and artistic context
