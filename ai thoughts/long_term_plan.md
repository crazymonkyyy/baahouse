- Automated testing and validation suite
- Performance improvements

### Success Metrics
- Codebase maintainability score improvement
- Tile set diversity and uniqueness validation
- Tool execution performance improvements

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion (Months 7-12)

### Goals
- Implement advanced tile operations
- Add compression capabilities
- Create composition tools

### Deliverables
- Tile transformation and combination tools
